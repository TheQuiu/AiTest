# Eternal Algorithm

Eternal Algorithm is a simple neural network designed to determine the sentiment of a sentence. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, this project is aimed at developers who are looking to build basic sentiment analysis functionality into their applications.

## Usage

To use Eternal Algorithm, simply pass in a sentence as a string, and the neural network will determine whether the sentiment of the sentence is positive, negative, or neutral. The output will be returned as a string with one of the following values: "positive", "negative".

## Development

This project was built using the following technologies:

- TensorFlow and Keras: These are popular and reliable frameworks for building neural networks, and were used to create the core functionality of the network.

- PyCord: PyCord is a Python wrapper for the Discord API. It was used to integrate the neural network with Discord, allowing users to interact with it through a chatbot.

- NumPy: NumPy is a powerful library for working with arrays and matrices in Python. It was used to provide additional functionality and efficiency to the neural network.

## Future Development

In the future, we plan to expand Eternal Algorithm by incorporating additional natural language processing techniques, such as part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. We also plan to integrate it with other platforms, such as Slack and Telegram.
